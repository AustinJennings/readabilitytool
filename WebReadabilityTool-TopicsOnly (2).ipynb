      "*May 21, 2018 (View this document as a PDF) Influenza activity was moderate in Pierce County during the 2017-2018 season. This compares to higher activity nationally this season and higher activity in the county last season. Oct. 2, 2017 (week 40) through April 12, 2018 (week 15), we received notification of 548 influenza‑associated hospitalizations and 31 influenza-associated deaths in Pierce County. The median age of hospitalized patients was 66.5 years (range: two weeks to 100 years). The median age of people who died was 81 years (range: 44 to 102 years). Influenza-associated hospitalization peaked in January, declined weeks four through seven, then trended upward again to a second peak in week 11 (week ending March 17, 2018). The second peak was largely driven by an increase in influenza B activity, a trend also seen nationally. Risk Factors Our epidemiology nurses review hospitalization records for demographic information and influenza-related complication risk factors. Of 548 reported influenza-associated hospitalizations, 457 (83%) had at least one comorbid condition that increases the risk of complications. The most commonly reported conditions: \n",
      "Diabetes 164 (36%)\n",
      "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 147 (32%)\n",
      "Chronic heart disease 157 (34%)\n",
      "    \n",
      "Congestive heart failure 76 (48%)\n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Congestive heart failure 76 (48%)\n",
      " Congestive heart failure 76 (48%) Obesity has emerged as a risk factor for influenza complications. Of the 490 non-pregnant adults hospitalized with influenza, 344 (70%) were overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m2) and 211 (43%) were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The median BMI of non-pregnant adults hospitalized with influenza was 28.6 kg/m2. Of 502 adults hospitalized with influenza, 86 (17%) were smokers, 229 (46%) were former smokers and 180 (36%) reported never smoking. The mean ages of hospitalized adults with regard to smoking: \n",
      "Smokers 55 years\n",
      "Former smokers 70 years\n",
      "Never smoked 68 years\n",
      " Smokers 55 years Former smokers 70 years Never smoked 68 years The mean age of smokers was significantly lower than the mean age of former smokers and those who never smoked (p<0.00001). The difference between the mean age of former smokers and those who never smoked was not significant. (p=0.35).  Discussion We should cautiously interpret apparent influenza activity increases in previous seasons because of improved reporting of influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. Influenza A was the dominant virus week 39 of 2017 through week seven of 2018, then Influenza B became the dominant virus. Throughout the season in Pierce County, influenza B was identified in 43% of positive influenza specimens, 38% of influenza-associated hospitalizations and 35% of influenza-associated deaths. Pierce County 2017-2018 influenza season data reflect national trends for risks of influenza-associated complications and death. Hospitalization rates were higher for children under five years of age and adults 50 years and older than people age five to 49 years. Hospitalization rates were highest for adults 65 years and older. The mean age of people who died after being diagnosed with influenza was significantly higher than the mean age of people hospitalized with influenza who survived to discharge (76.5 years vs. 60.6 years, p<0.00001). Diabetes, chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease and obesity were the most common comorbid conditions among people hospitalized with influenza. The prevalence of COPD, diabetes and obesity among people hospitalized with influenza were significantly higher than the prevalence of those conditions in Pierce County (p<0.00001). Current smoking was significantly associated with influenza-associated hospitalization at a younger age when compared to former smokers and people who never smoked. Nearly all patients hospitalized with influenza in Pierce County received oseltamivir on admission or soon after testing positive for influenza. When reviewing hospitalization records, we look for documentation of receiving seasonal influenza vaccine. However, many people are vaccinated outside the healthcare system where they are admitted, so this information is not reliably available. Consequently, we cannot calculate vaccine effectiveness with available data.  Conclusions Although Pierce County influenza activity can differ from United States influenza activity, risk factors for influenza complications and death in Pierce County are similar to those observed nationally. Our data reinforce national guidelines for influenza prevention and treatment. People at high risk for influenza-associated complications should receive a seasonal influenza vaccine as soon it becomes available at the beginning of each influenza season. Prompt treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor can shorten the duration of illness and reduce the risk of influenza-associated complications. People at high risk for complications include children less than five years of age, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, residents of long-term care facilities, American Indians and Alaskan Natives and people with chronic medical conditions.

      " Influenza diagnosis \n",
      " Rapid diagnostic testing for influenza can help clinical decision-making. However, sensitivity of rapid tests is low, ranging from 50–70%. Rapid test may not detect novel or variant influenza viruses. Therefore, a negative rapid test does not rule out influenza. \n",

      "Positive and negative predictive values vary considerably depending upon influenza activity in the community.\n",
      "False-positive influenza test results are more likely to occur when influenza activity is low, which is generally at the beginning and end of an influenza season.\n",
      "False-negative influenza test results are more likely to occur when influenza activity is high, which is typically at the height of an influenza season.\n",
      " Positive and negative predictive values vary considerably depending upon influenza activity in the community.

      " Influenza Treatment \n",
      " Early treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms and may reduce the risk of complications from influenza (e.g., otitis media in young children, pneumonia, and respiratory failure). Early treatment of hospitalized patients can shorten the duration of hospitalization and improve survival. Neuraminidase inhibitors work best when given within 48 hours of flu onset. Because of the high prevalence of resistance, you should not use adamantanes (amandine, rimantadine) to treat influenza. For complete information on antiviral medications, see www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm. \n",
      " Surveillance Updates \n",
      "  The Health Department will continue its seasonal influenza surveillance through April.

      "*May 9, 2017 What are the procedures our school should follow if a student has head lice? Head lice are tiny parasites that can live on the human head. Head lice survive by sucking blood from the scalp. Lice eggs (called “nits”) can attach to strands of head hair. Head lice can cause the head to itch but have not been proven to cause disease. \n",
      " Head lice are very common among children and adolescents. Students of any income, social, or racial status can get head lice. Head lice are not a result of a student's poor personal hygiene, or unsanitary conditions at home, in the community, or at school. However, head lice historically carry a stigma of uncleanliness, so having head lice can often be embarrassing for the affected students, parents, families, and school. \n",
      " Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department follows current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Nurses, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address head lice. These guidelines have changed in recent years. Students with head lice no longer need to be immediately sent home and remain out of school until the lice and nits are gone. \n",
      " Students diagnosed with head lice can remain at school and finish the school day. However, as soon as head lice are diagnosed, the school should take the following actions: \n",
      "\n",
      "    The school nurse should instruct the affected student not to share combs, brushes, caps, pillowcases or other items touching the head or worn near the head, until the student is free from nits and lice.\n",

      "The nurse should notify the student’s parent/guardian that the student has head lice.\n",
      "    \n",
      "The nurse should provide instruction to parents/guardians on appropriate treatment, such as special combs and shampoos to remove nits and lice. The student should begin treatment at home that day, after school.\n",

      "The student should be allowed to return to school if appropriate treatment has begun.\n",
      "    \n",

Examples include influenza, respiratory MRSA (which also requires contact precautions), rubella, meningococcal meningitis, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV—which also requires contact precautions) and pertussis. The World Health Organization recognizes the droplet route for Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Reason to use droplet precautions: \n",
      "They reduce the risk of transmitting the disease to the healthcare worker.\n",
      "They prevent the healthcare worker from transmitting disease to other patients.\n",
      " They reduce the risk of transmitting the disease to the healthcare worker. They prevent the healthcare worker from transmitting disease to other patients. Components of droplet precautions include standard precautions, plus: \n",

      " Meningococcal disease is a sudden, severe illness caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. The disease manifests most commonly as meningitis and/or meningococcemia, but may also cause pneumonia, arthritis, or pericarditis. The symptoms include sudden high fever, chills, severe headache, stiff neck and back, nausea, vomiting, purpural rash, decreased level of consciousness, difficulty breathing, and seizures. \n",
      " Epidemiology During 2005-2011, an estimated 800-1,200 cases of meningococcal disease occurred annually in the United States, representing an incidence of 0.3 cases per 100,000 population. Incidence has declined annually since a peak of disease in the late 1990s. Asymptomatic carriage of N. meningitidis in the nose and throat is common, possibly as high as 20%. Though these individuals may not exhibit symptoms or illness, they can spread the infection to others. Since 2005, declines have occurred among all age groups and in all vaccine-contained serogroups.  Attack rates are highest among infants 3–12 months of age. The case-fatality of meningococcal disease is 10% to 15%, even with appropriate antibiotic therapy. The case-fatality of meningococcemia is up to 40%. As many as 20% of survivors have permanent sequelae, such as hearing loss, neurologic damage, or loss of a limb. Approximately 60% of disease among children aged 0 through 59 months is caused by serogroup B. Serogroups C, W, or Y, which are included in vaccines routinely given to adolescents in the United States, cause 73% of all cases of meningococcal disease among persons 11 years of age or older. Serogroup A, which rarely causes disease in the United States, is the most common cause of epidemics in Africa. Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine that offers protection against serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 are given routinely at age 11. For longer duration of protection, a dose is repeated after the 16th birthday. Two vaccine products are available against serogroup B that can be given to adolescents on request. This vaccine has been used as a control measure for outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on college campuses in the U.S. Transmission/Incubation Meningococcal disease is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of a carrier or ill person.  The organism cannot be spread simply by being in the same room with an infected person. Household contacts are at highest risk for transmission, but transmission is possible through sharing of eating utensils, glassware, cigarettes, or toothbrushes. The incubation period varies from two to ten days, most commonly is three to four days. Diagnosis Meningococcal disease is most commonly diagnosed by isolation of N meningitides from blood or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). After administration of any antibiotics, sensitivity of bacterial culture can be low.  In this situation, a Gram stain of CSF, assays to detect bacterial antigen in CSF, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be helpful. Prophylaxis of Contacts Antibiotics are given to close contacts of cases with meningococcal disease. Close contacts include household members, intimate contacts, health care personnel performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, day care center playmates and very close friends with whom the case may have shared cups and/or utensils.  Casual contacts such as classmates or co-workers usually do not require treatment. The preventive medications are: Rifampin (drug of choice for most children- not recommended for pregnant women). \n",

      "Since the mid-1990s, the number of hepatitis A cases reported in the U.S. has fallen sharply due to routine childhood vaccination for hepatitis A. In Pierce County, there have been from 0-5 cases per year since 2007. Diagnosis Positive hepatitis A IgM and markedly elevated ALT and AST (hundreds to thousands) are diagnostic of acute hepatitis A.  False positive hepatitis A IgM is common; in the absence of illness and/or elevated liver enzymes, hepatitis A IgM is not significant. Vaccine Recommendations Two doses of hepatitis A vaccine, given six months apart after age 12 months are approximately 99% effective at preventing disease. One dose is approximately 95% effective. Although most children in the U.S. have received hepatitis A immunization, many adults are susceptible. Hepatitis A vaccine is routinely recommended for international travelers, men who have sex with men, and persons with pre-existing liver disease (including hepatitis C). However, there is no recommendation for routine immunization of adults at this time. Infants and very young children usually show no signs of hepatitis A. Families who adopt infants or young children from developing countries should be vaccinated. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Unimmunized household, sexual and close contacts of persons diagnosed with hepatitis A should receive post-exposure prophylaxis. The following regimens are recommended: \n",
      "Healthy persons age 12 months-40 years who have received no previous doses of hepatitis A vaccine should be vaccinated as soon possible after exposure.\n",
      "Infants < 12 months, persons over age 40, and persons with chronic illness should receive immune globulin 0.02ml/kg within 2 weeks of exposure. Persons who have had at least one dose of vaccine do not need immune globulin.\n",

      "*\n",
      "*June 7, 2017  Background and Epidemiology West Nile virus (WNV) infections first emerged as a public health problem in the United States in the late 1990s. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the same family as yellow fever, dengue fever and St. Louis encephalitis. Other routes of transmission in rare situations are blood transfusions, organ transplant, transplacental, breastfeeding, and percutaneous injuries of laboratory workers. In the United States, outbreaks occur from late spring through autumn when mosquitoes are active. Usually, WNV outbreaks are associated with bird die-offs and cases in horses and other mammals that may precede or occur simultaneously with human cases. In Washington State, WNV activity has historically been very low. Since surveillance began, the highest level of WNV activity occurred in 2009 when there were 38 human cases (36 were acquired in Washington State), 73 cases in horses or other mammals, and 22 dead birds tested positive. In 2016, there were 9 human cases in Washington and 24 human cases in 2015 (none in Pierce County).  Although WNV has historically been detected in dead birds in Pierce County, most WNV activity in Washington State occurs in Eastern Washington. Across the U.S., WNV outbreak activity varies from year to year. From 1999 to 2015, the states reporting the most cases (from 2,214 to 5,589, in order) are Illinois, Nebraska, Texas, Colorado and California. During the same time period, Washington State reported 87 cases. When to Suspect WNV Infection A person who hasn’t traveled outside of Western Washington is unlikely to have WNV. However, local presence of WNV infection in birds/animals/humans or travel to areas with WNV activity should raise suspicion in persons with unexplained meningitis or encephalitis. Recent history of transfusion, transplant or vaccination may be important. Testing for WNV or other arboviral disease such as St. Louis encephalitis should be strongly considered in: \n",
      "Adults > 18 years with unexplained encephalitis or meningitis, particularly in summer or early fall.\n",

      " In September of 2012, the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health announced a new form of coronavirus, since named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).  So far all cases have been linked (by residence or travel) to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula*, most in Saudi Arabia.  As of June 2017, there have been nearly 2,000 cases of MERS with at least 691 related deaths. Only 2 patients have ever been identified in the U.S., both health care workers exposed while providing care to patients in Saudi Arabia. Although the majority of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections, camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. However, the exact role of camels in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown. The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing unprotected care to a patient. Most confirmed MERS-CoV infections have resulted in severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Incubation period ranges from 2-14 days. Providers and facilities should immediately report to the Health Department if they suspect MERS-CoV and institute infection control precautions (airborne, contact and standard precautions).

Washington State Public Health Laboratories can test respiratory and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by using a CDC-developed PCR assay.  Call TPCHD to coordinate testing at the state public health lab. Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (airborne precautions) when collecting clinical specimens for MERS-CoV testing.  Ideally, collect respiratory specimens from two or more sites, such as a nasopharyngeal swab and a lower respiratory tract sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash, or tracheal aspirate.  Lower respiratory samples are preferred.  Refer to the CDC Interim guidelines for collection, processing, and transport of clinical specimens from patients under investigation for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) for more details. *Countries considered in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring include: Bahrain; Iraq; Iran; Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; the United Arab Emirates (UAE); and Yemen. \n",

      "*May 25, 2018 Hundreds of synthetic cannabinoid chemicals are manufactured and sold. Synthetic cannabinoids are used in a variety of ways, including: \n",

      "Used in electronic nicotine delivery devices (like e-cigarettes).\n",
      "Ingested when added to herbal tea or food.\n",
      " Sprayed onto plant material and smoked. Used in electronic nicotine delivery devices (like e-cigarettes). Ingested when added to herbal tea or food. Synthetic cannabinoids are widely available. Consumers can buy synthetic cannabinoids in convenience stores; from individual drug dealers or friends; or online as incense or natural herbal products. They are sold under many different brand names, but are commonly referred to as synthetic marijuana, fake weed, legal weed, K2 and spice. Adverse effects from synthetic cannabinoids use vary and can include neurological (e.g., agitation or confusion), psychiatric (e.g., hallucinations or delusions) and other physical (e.g., tachypnea, tachycardia or gastrointestinal distress) signs and symptoms. In March 2018, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported cases of unexplained bleeding among patients who reported using synthetic cannabinoids. Subsequent testing of drug and biological samples from case-patients detected the presence of brodifacoum, a long-acting vitamin K-dependent antagonist used as a rodenticide. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is coordinating national surveillance activities for possible cases of vitamin K-dependent antagonist coagulopathy associated with synthetic cannabinoids use. Since the index case was identified in Illinois on March 3, 2018, state health departments have reported 202 cases, including five deaths, to CDC. Case-patients have been identified in nine states with the majority reported from Illinois (n=164). Maryland has reported 20 cases. Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin have reported six or fewer cases per state. More than 95 of case-patient biological samples have tested positive for brodifacoum. The current working hypothesis is that brodifacoum was mixed with synthetic cannabinoids products. Case-patients from this outbreak presented with a variety of signs and symptoms of coagulopathy (e.g., bruising, nosebleeds, excessively heavy menstrual bleeding, hematemesis, hemoptysis, hematuria, flank pain, abdominal pain and bleeding gums or mouth). In addition, some patients were asymptomatic or presented with complaints unrelated to bleeding but whose numerical coagulopathy may put them at risk for bleeding complications resulting from injuries and invasive or surgical procedures. Patients should be considered high-risk for coagulopathy if they have reported use of or are suspected of using synthetic cannabinoids. The most helpful and commonly available laboratory test to help identify cases is the International Normalized Ratio (INR) that is part of a routine coagulation profile. An abnormal INR is defined as being outside the reference laboratory value, which can vary somewhat among individual laboratories. For case reporting purposes, an INR greater than two is being used as a criterion to help identify and classify possible cases.
